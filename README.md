#Password Validation Script

Welcome to pwstrength.ps1, a tool that checks the strength of potential passwords.
This is a powershell script.
You will be asked to enter a (potential) password, after which a number of checks will be made to evaluate its strength as a password.
Its strength will then be shown to you, measured as a number out of 100 (the maximum score).
Whatever you enter next will not be displayed to the screen.
When the script exits, it automatically erases your input making sure that no passwords will be saved.
